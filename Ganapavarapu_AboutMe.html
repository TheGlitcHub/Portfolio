<p>I am <strong>Joshua Ganapavarapu</strong>, and I am a programmer. I am a freshman at Dublin High, and currently taking <i>Computer Science Principles 1</i>. I work with HTML and CSS, and this website that you are on right now is a product of my coding. I aspire to be a Computer Software Engineer for Gaming Graphics.</p>

<p>My first steps in computer programming started back in 3rd and 4th grade, when I took MindStorm Robotics classes. It introduced me to motors and hardware, along with coding blocks for the software part.</p>

<p>During the summer leading up to my 5th grade, I took my first programming course. It was on Khan Academy, focusing on JavaScript, specifically <i>Proccesing.JS</i>. Apart from the course exercises, I would make my own fun mini games using the JS I knew.</p>

<p><i>One program that I built made it to this list on Khan Academy of the top computer programs for the day, called the Hot list.</i> It was a non-interactive program that threw geometric 3d shapes across the screen and made them bounce against the screen and it's dimensions. You can find it in my projects page. My program was presented to some MS students at a Professional Web Developer Class run by my dad, and the students were impressed by that work of an early 5th grader.</p>

<p>Back in 7th grade, I took a class called Design and Modeling, which is a computer graphic design class. I used a software called SketchUp (similar to AutoDesk Inventor) to design models of shapes to guide build/sculpt components that make-up final product.</p>

<p>In 2020, I look forward to enhancing my graphics programming skills and learning new ones on MatLab and OpenGL. I also hope to improve my Python programming skills and make new ones on Codecademy</p>

<p>When not programming, I enjoy gaming, playing basketball and hanging out with my friends. I am also a fast swimmer and qualified for competitive swimming a few years back, but did not pursue it. Over the summer, I traveled to Hawaii with my family and swam in the beaches.</p>
